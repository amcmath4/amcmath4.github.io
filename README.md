# Welcome to our Fall 2021 IT Capstone Project!
## What is this project?
The IT Capstone Project is a class assigned to senior IT students at Kennesaw State University that is designed to apply their skills to real-world applications. In the case of our project we were assigned to build a small business web server, secure it with open-source software, and to attempt to infiltrate the servers of other teams assigned to the project. 
Our class was instructed by Dr. Ying Xie, and our project sponsor was Dr. Lei Li.
